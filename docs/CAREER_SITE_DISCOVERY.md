# Career-site discovery pilot

## Cohort and cost

The first pilot covers every consolidated company with `priority_score >= 4.5`:

- Companies: 103
- Successful searches: 103
- Effective pilot search credits: 103
- Additional cancelled dry-run searches: 26
- Total Tavily basic-search credits consumed: approximately 129
- Tavily basic search cost: one credit per company

No LLM or browser rendering is used. Tavily returns candidates; it does not
verify or enable them.

## Pilot result

After automatic removal of known aggregators and external job boards:

- Companies with candidates awaiting review: 100
- Companies with no retained candidate: 3
- Review candidates: 245
- Verified sites: 0 until human review
- Crawl-enabled sites: 0 until human review

Candidate source distribution:

| Source | Candidates |
|---|---:|
| Generic official-looking HTML | 210 |
| Workday | 21 |
| Greenhouse | 7 |
| iCIMS | 3 |
| Lever | 3 |
| SmartRecruiters | 1 |

## TablePlus review workflow

Open schema `jobpush`, then use only **`career_site_review_workbench`** for
human work. It is the canonical one-company-per-row surface and contains up to
three candidates plus the verified URL. It sorts:

1. manual P0 needing review;
2. verified manual P0 (kept visible, including Google);
3. Chicago + LinkedIn, Chicago, LinkedIn, large sponsors;
4. remaining score/diverse samples.

Older `career_site_review_queue` and `career_site_company_review_queue` views
remain only for backward-compatible scripts. They are not the human entry
point.

Review candidate 1 first. If it is wrong, inspect candidate 2 and candidate 3.
The detailed one-row-per-URL view is `career_site_review_queue`.

Confirm a site:

```sql
SELECT jobpush.review_career_site(
    12345, 'verified', 'nicole', 'Official company career or ATS site'
);
```

Reject a site:

```sql
SELECT jobpush.review_career_site(
    12345, 'rejected', 'nicole', 'Aggregator, wrong entity, or unrelated brand'
);
```

Replace `12345` with the candidate site ID shown in the review view. Confirming
a site enables it for future crawling and marks the company `found`. Rejecting
one candidate keeps the company in review while other candidates remain.

## Generalization loop

1. Human-review the 100 pilot companies.
2. Measure rank-1 precision and source-specific precision.
3. Add recurring false domains to
   `career_site_discovery_domain_excludes` and the Python deny list.
4. Add adapters for confirmed ATS sources.
5. Run a stratified 4.0/3.0/2.5 sample; only low-confidence candidates require
   human review.

Human review is a calibration sample, not a requirement for every company.
`career_site_review_precision` measures verified/rejected precision by source
type and candidate rank. Auto-verification may be enabled later only for a
narrow structured-ATS segment after it has enough reviewed examples and at
least 98% observed precision. Generic HTML and conflicting candidates remain
manual.

## Effective-tier expansion (2026-06-23)

The first expansion searched 150 never-searched P-tier companies, with manual
P0 first and high-score P1/P2 after it. It used 150 Tavily basic credits,
completed with zero search errors, and retained 381 candidates. The ranked
company review queue then contained 2 P0 and 221 P1 companies.

A second 50-company potential-P0 sample deliberately avoided alphabetical
selection. It stratified Chicago, LinkedIn Top Employer, large LCA sponsor, and
cross-score random groups. It retained 123 candidates with zero search errors;
examples include Ford, General Motors, Nike, Siemens, Bloomberg, Morningstar,
Medtronic, Deere, Motorola, Dropbox, and Chicago employers.

Known external aggregators such as TechFetch belong in both the database domain
exclude table and `scripts/discover_career_sites.py`; they must never be
verified as a company-owned career site.

`career_site_discovery_runs` records company counts, candidates, errors, and
estimated credits for every completed batch.
